# ThousandEyes - Application Transaction Examples
These .js files are a collection of Javascript synthetic transaction examples for typical user workflows on common SaaS and web applcations. Each of the .js scripts listed here represent a complete transaction test and can be used standalone. 

Where credentials are required the examples will use `myCredentials` and a placeholder for username.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or just download/copy an individual .js transaction script file. 
2. In ThousandEyes [create a new application synthetic transaction test](https://www.thousandeyes.com/resources/getting-started-with-transactions-tutorial).
3. Paste in the contents of .js transaction script file (or select `Import from JS File`)
4. Set any other test settings and save the test. Recommended to start with 3-5 agents, Round Robin testing with 10/1 minute test intervals. 
5. If any credentials are required create a new credential with `myCredentials` or rename the credential name in the transaction script to use your own. Open the Transaciton test, select the credentials button and check your credential. Make sure your credential name matches what's used in the transaction.
